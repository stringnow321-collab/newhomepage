            <p1>Throughout human civilization, there has been a pursuit of plants for their unique potential, including
                medicinal use. Evidence of this dates back to 60,000 years, with a recent discovery of a 5,000-year-old
                Sumerian clay tablet that confirms the use of medicinal plants in drug production (Sumner, 2000).
                Natural resources like medicinal plants, also known as green medicine, are gaining popularity worldwide
                due to their safety, effectiveness, cultural acceptance, and lower risk of adverse effects compared to
                synthetic medications (Mustafa et al., 2017). Today, traditional botanical medicines are widely used to
                treat human health problems, with over 80% of the global population depending on them (Mander and Liu,
                2010).</p1>
